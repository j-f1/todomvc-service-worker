# Service Worker-only implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

Todo:

- persist on Safari (looks like IDB doesnâ€™t work. Maybe store in cached URL?)
- esc to cancel editing (maybe just invite user to reload or smth?)
- do not persist editing mode (maybe reset it when loading page?)
- escape user supplied text
